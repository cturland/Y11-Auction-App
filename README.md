## Project Tasks  

### **Task 1 – Auction Setup**  
- The administrator can add at least **10 auction items**.  
- Each item must include:  
  - A unique item number  
  - Description  
  - Reserve price  
  - Starting bid (set at 0)  

### **Task 2 – Buyer Bidding**  
- Buyers (with unique IDs) can:  
  - View item descriptions  
  - See the current highest bid  
  - Place new bids (must be higher than the current bid)  
- The system should update and record the bid count for each item.  

### **Task 3 – Conclusion of Auction**  
At the end of the auction, the system should:  
- Mark items as **sold** if the highest bid ≥ reserve price.  
- Calculate a **10% auction fee** for each sold item.  
- Present a **summary report** showing:  
  - Total fees collected  
  - Items that did not meet their reserve price  
  - Items with no bids  
  - Statistics: number of sold, unsold, and bidless items
